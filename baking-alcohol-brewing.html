                    <p>Over the recent years, KLSs has built up considerable expertise in enzymes for the baking, alcohol and brewing industries. Some notable successes are the launching of xylanase enzyme for baking industry and beta glucanase enzyme for brewing industry.</p>

                    <p>Enzymes are proteins that catalyze biochemical reactions. A whole range of enzymes are used in the baking industry where they improve the processing or quality parameters of goods such as bread, buns, rolls, cakes, biscuits, etc. Typical effects that can be achieved by using enzymes are extended shelf life, improved dough fermentation, dough machinability and stability, increased loaf volume, fi ner and whiter crumb structure and intensified crust colour. The use of enzymes allows for the replacement of chemical additives.</p>

                     <p>
                     For decades, enzymes such as malt and fungal alpha-amylases have been used in bread-making. Rapid advances in biotechnology have made a number of exciting new enzymes available for the baking industry. The importance of enzymes is likely to increase as consumers demand more natural products free of chemical additives. For example, enzymes can be used to replace potassium bromate, a chemical additive that has been banned in a number of countries.<br /> <br />
                    The dough for bread, rolls, buns and similar products consists of flour, water, yeast, salt and possibly other ingredients such as sugar and fat. Flour consists of gluten, starch, non-starch polysaccharides, lipids and trace amounts of minerals. As soon as the dough is made, the yeast starts to work on the fermentable sugars, transforming them into alcohol and carbon dioxide, which makes the dough rise.<br /><br />
                    The main component of wheat flour is starch. Amylases can degrade starch and produce small dextrins for the yeast to act upon. There is also a special type of amylase that modifies starch during baking to give a significant anti-staling effect<br /> <br />
                    Gluten is a combination of proteins that forms a large network during dough formation. This network holds the gas in during dough proofing and baking. The strength of this gluten network is therefore extremely important for the quality of all bread raised using yeast. Enzymes such as hemicellulases, xylanases, lipases and oxidases can directly or indirectly improve the strength of the gluten network and so improve the quality of the finished bread.

                     Flour contains 2.5-3.5% non-starch polysaccharides, which are large polymers (mainly pentosans) that play an important role in bread quality due to their water absorption capability and interactions with gluten. It is well known that the addition of certain types of pentosanases or xylanases at the correct dosage can improve dough machinability yielding more flexible, easier-to-handle dough. Consequently, the dough is more stable and gives better ovenspring during baking, resulting in a larger volume and improved crumb texture.<br /> <br />

                     The alpha-amylases degrade the damaged starch in wheat flour into small dextrins, which allows yeast to work continuously during dough fermentation, proofing and the early stage of baking. The result is improved bread volume and crumb texture. <br /> <br />

                     Proteases are used on a large commercial scale in the production of pastries, biscuits and cookies, baked goods, crackers and waffles. These enzymes can be added to reduce mixing time, to decrease dough consistency, to assure dough uniformity, to regulate gluten strength in bread, to control bread texture and to improve the flavor. In addition, proteases have largely replaced bisulfite, which was previously used to control the consistency through reduction of gluten protein disulfide bonds, while proteolysis breaks down peptide bonds. In both cases, the final effect is a similar weakening of the gluten network. They act on the proteins of wheat flour, reducing gluten elasticity and therefore reducing shrinkage of dough or paste after moulding and sheeting <br /> <br />

                     For the production of fermented alcohol drinks, starch is use as primary raw materials. Starch is composed of long chains of glucose molecules and these have to be broken down into smaller molecules, which the yeast can transform into alcohol. Enzymes can carry out this process in two stages-liquefaction and saccharification.<br /> <br />
                    Amylase enzymes necessary for starch utilization, the currently available production process requires that the raw starch be gelatinated by cooking, liquified by alpha-amylase treatment and saccharified to fermentable sugars (glucose) by glucoamylase treatment. During fermentation, these sugars are converted into alcohol by yeast in simultaneous saccharification and fermentation process.<br /><br />
                    Cereals maize have low soluble nitrogen. This results in poor yeast growth and longer fermentation time. By adding a small amount of protease enzyme helps in yeast growth and reduce fermentation time. During distillation process it may be necessary to reduce viscosity of the fermentation broth. <br /> <br />

                     Even for an old industry like beer brewing new industrial processes benefit from using enzymes developed from microbial sources. In the last years quality issues like flavour control, beer stability and general cost savings in the industry go hand in hand with efficient solutions of environmental problems. Future aspects focus on a wider application of enzymes to brew with high amounts of inexpensive raw materials like barley.<br /> <br />
                   Traditionally, beer is produced by mixing crushed barley malt and hot water in a mash copper to perform the mashing. Besides malt, other starchy cereals such as maize, sorghum, rice and barley, or pure starch itself, can be added to the mash. These are known as adjuncts.
                    After mashing, the mash is sieved in a lauter tun or on a mash filter. The resulting liquid, known as sweet wort, is then transferred to the copper, where it is boiled with hops. The hopped wort is cooled and transferred to the fermentation vessels, where yeast is added. In normal wort 2/3 of the carbohydrates are fermentable sugars. After fermentation, the so-called ‘green beer' is matured before final filtration and bottling. <br /><br />
